# lotteryjudgements
The code in this project replicates the analysis in the paper "Lottery Judgments: A Philosophical and Experimental Study" (2017). P. Ebert, M. Smith, and I. Durbach. To appear in: Philosophical Psychology.

To replicate the analysis in the paper only, use "s1_analysis.R" and "s2_analysis.R".

The two files "s1_dataprep.R" and "s2_dataprep.R" perform some background pre-processing of the raw experimental data.
